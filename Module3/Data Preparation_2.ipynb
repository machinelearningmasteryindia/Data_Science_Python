Just as visualization is necessary to understand the relationships in data, proper preparation or **data munging** is required to ensure machine learning models work optimally. \n","\n","The process of data preparation is highly interactive and iterative. A typical process includes at least the following steps:\n","1. **Visualization** of the dataset to understand the relationships and identify possible problems with the data.\n","2. **Data cleaning and transformation** to address the problems identified. It many cases, step 1 is then repeated to verify that the cleaning and transformation had the desired effect. \n","3. **Construction and evaluation of a machine learning models**. Visualization of the results will often lead to understanding of further data preparation that is required; going back to step 1. \n","\n","In this lab we will learn the following: \n"," + Recode character strings to eliminate characters that will not be processed correctly.\n"," + Find and treat missing values. \n"," + Set correct data type of each column. \n"," + Transform categorical features to create categories with more cases and coding likely to be useful in predicting the label. \n"," + Apply transformations to numeric features and the label to improve the distribution properties. \n"," + Locate and treat duplicate cases. \n","\n","We will work on Housing Price datasets for this lab."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8pAZiMwPqbLJ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":125},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1577617294198,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":33020,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi

Poor data preparation is often the source of poor machine learning model performance. \n","\n","The first step in preparing these data is to create **independently sampled** **training dataset** and **validation dataset**. In most cases, an independently sampled **test dataset** will also be used. In this case, no model improvement or comparison will be performed so this additional step is unnecessary. \n","\n","If the same data are used to train and test a machine learning model, there is a high likelihood that the model will simply be learning the training data. In technical terms one can say that there is **information leakage** between the training and test processes. In this case, the model may not **generalize** well. A model that generalizes well produces consistent results when presented with new cases, never before encountered. Conversely, a model with poor generalization might give unexpected results when presented with a new case. \n","\n","The random sub-samples of the data are created using a process called **Bernoulli sampling**. Bernoulli sampling accepts a sample into the data subset with probability $p$. In this case, the probability that a given case is in the training dataset is $p$. The probability a case is in the test dataset then becomes $1-p$. \n","\n","The `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module performed the required Bernoulli sampling.

variables**\n","\n","Now that the dataset is split, the numeric feature column must be re-scaled. Rescaling of numeric features is extremely important. The numeric range of a feature should not determine how much that feature determines the training of the machine learning model. \n","\n","For example, consider a data set with two features, age in years, typically measured in a few tens, and income, typically measured in tens or hundreds of thousands. There is no reason to believe that income is more important than age in some model, simply because its range of values is greater. To prevent this problem numeric features are scaled to the same range. \n","\n","There are many possible scaling method which are:\n"," + Standard Scaler\n"," + MinMax Scaler\n"," + Robust Scaler\n"," + Normalizer\n","\n","**Standard Scaler**\n","\n","The Standard Scaler assumes your data is normally distributed within each feature and will scale them such that the distribution is now centred around 0, with a standard deviation of 1.\n","\n","The mean and standard deviation are calculated for the feature and then the feature is scaled based on:\n","\n","$$x\\_scaled_i = \\frac{\\big(x_i - \\mu \\big)}{\\sigma}$$\n","\n","where,\n"," + $\\mu $ is the mean of the variable $X$,\n"," + $\\sigma $ is the standard deviation of the variable $X$.\n","\n","If data is not normally distributed, this is not the best scaler to use.\n","\n","**MinMax Scaler**\n","\n","Another method is known as **Min-Max** normalization. The data are scaled using the following formula to be in the range $\\{ 0,1 \\}$:\n","\n","$$x\\_scaled_i = \\frac{(x_i - Min(x))}{(Max(x) - Min(x))}$$\n","\n","where,\n","$x_i $ is the ith sample value,\n","$Min(X) $ is the minimum value of all samples,\n","$Max(X) $ is the maximum value of all samples.\n","\n","In general, Min-Max normalization is a good choice for cases where the value being scaled has a complex distribution. For example, a variable with a distribution with multiple modes might be a good candidate for Min-Max normalization. Notice that the presence of a few outliers can distort the result by giving unrepresentative values of $Min(X)$ or $Max(X)$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CwTqNB2EYT4h","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The code in the cell below uses the `StandardScaler` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` package.
