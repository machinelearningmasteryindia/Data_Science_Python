Exploratory data analysis is very important step in any supervised learning problem as it helps to understand underlying behaviour and pattern of data.\n","\n","Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization. First to understand the relationships between the data columns. Second to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified. \n","\n","In this lab, we will explore hidden pattern of **House Prices: Advanced Regression Technique**s data.
