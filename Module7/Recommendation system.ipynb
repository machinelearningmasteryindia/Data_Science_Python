They are primarily used in commercial applications. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)\n","\n","A Recommender System employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users' ratings for a particular entity, based on the similarity between the entities or similarity between the users that previously rated those entities. The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"75ZjxhnfAk11","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Types of Recommender Systems**\n","There are two major approaches to build recommender systems: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering:\n","\n","**Content-Based Filtering**\n","\n","In content-based filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products. For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc.\n","\n","**Collaborative Filtering**\n","\n","Collaborative filtering leverages the power of the crowd. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that he will like the product Y as well.\n","\n","Take the example of a movie recommender system. Suppose a huge number of users have assigned the same ratings to movies X and Y. A new user comes who has assigned the same rating to movie X but hasn't watched movie Y yet. Collaborative filtering system will recommend him the movie Y."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mlfvTF1vDnGE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Dataset**\n","The dataset that we are going to use for this problem is the MovieLens Dataset.

Based on what we like, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content to recommend us.\n","\n","A major drawback of this algorithm is that it is limited to recommending items that are of the same type. It will never recommend products which the user has not bought or liked in the past. So if a user has watched or liked only action movies in the past, the system will recommend only action movies. It’s a very narrow way of building an engine.\n","\n","How to measure the similarity? there are different measures of similarity :\n","\n"," 1. Euclidean Distance\n"," 2. Cosine similarity\n"," 3.

One way of handling this problem is to select only a few users (neighbors) instead of all to make predictions, i.e. instead of making predictions for all similarity values, we choose only few similarity values.

Sort the movies based on the score and output the top results.\n","\n","As **`ratings`** are already available, we are going to consider this as our metric for scoring the movies. However, using this metric has a few caveats. For one, it does not take into consideration the popularity of a movie. Therefore, a movie with a rating of 9 from 10 voters will be considered 'better' than a movie with a rating of 8.9 from 10,000 voters.\n","\n","On a related note, this metric will also tend to favor movies with smaller number of voters with skewed and/or extremely high ratings. As the number of voters increase, the rating of a movie regularizes and approaches towards a value that is reflective of the movie's quality. It is more difficult to discern the quality of a movie with extremely few voters.\n","\n","Taking these shortcomings into consideration, it is necessary that we come up with a weighted rating that takes into account the average rating and the number of votes it has garnered. For this, we are going to use weighted rating formula(as per IMDB) as your metric/score. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:\n","\n","$$WR = (\\frac{v}{v+m}.R) + (\\frac{m}{v+m}.C)$$\n","\n","where, \n","\n"," + v is the number of votes for the movie;\n"," + m is the minimum
