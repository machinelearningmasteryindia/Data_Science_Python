Introduction\n","\n","This chapte outlines techniques for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python. The topic is very broad: datasets can come from a wide range of sources and a wide range of formats, including be collections of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else. Despite this apparent heterogeneity, it will help us to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.\n","\n","For example, images–particularly digital images–can be thought of as simply two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area. Sound clips can be thought of as one-dimensional arrays of intensity versus time. Text can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps binary digits representing the frequency of certain words or pairs of words. No matter what the data are, the first step in making it analyzable will be to transform them into arrays of numbers. (We will discuss some specific examples of this process later in Feature Engineering)\n","\n","For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science. We'll now take a look at the specialized tools that Python has for handling such numerical arrays: the `NumPy` package, and the `Pandas` package (discussed in Chapter 3).\n","\n","`NumPy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n","\n","  + a powerful N-dimensional array object\n","  + sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n","  + tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n","  + useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n","\n","Besides its obvious scientific uses, `NumPy` can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n","\n","This chapter will cover `NumPy` in detail. `NumPy` (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but `NumPy` arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size. NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you.\n","\n","If you followed the advice outlined in the Preface and installed the Anaconda stack, you already have `NumPy` installed and ready to go. If you're more the do-it-yourself type, you can go to this [link](http://www.numpy.org/)  and follow the installation instructions found there. Once you do, you can import `NumPy` and double-check the version:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mpZSVEuiSGhn","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1575291812221,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2247,"user":{"displayName":"Arjun Banerjee","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h8VhbeeQuGM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAes/IOySeLLTNeE/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09443568139692021287"}},"outputId":"c514daba-f9c6-49f9-bad1-a4bcaf3ba57f"},"source":["import numpy\n","numpy.__version__"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'1.17.4'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":1}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JymREPqyWDKn"},"source":["For the pieces of the package discussed here, I'd recommend NumPy version 1.8 or later.

These keywords will test the truth value of the entire array (not element-by-element as you might expect). Use the bitwise operators `&` and `|` instead.\n","\n","> The bit-wise operators `&` and `|` are the proper way to perform element-by-element array comparisons. Be sure you understand the operator precedence: `(a > 2) & (a < 5)` is the proper syntax because `a > 2 & a < 5` will result in an error due to the fact that `2 & a` is evaluated first.\n","\n","> the behavior of `maximum(a, b)` is different than that of `max(a, b)`. As a ufunc, `maximum(a, b)` performs an element-by-element comparison of `a` and `b` and chooses each element of the result according to which element in the two arrays is larger. In contrast, `max(a, b)`` treats the objects `a` and `b` as a whole, looks at the (total) truth value of `a > b` and uses it to return either `a or b` (as a whole). A similar difference exists between `minimum(a, b)`` and `min(a, b)``."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QhcMuzzMSH5z"},"source":["# Reference\n","\n","  1.
